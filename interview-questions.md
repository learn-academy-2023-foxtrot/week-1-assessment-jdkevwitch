# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software that manages updated versions of code as they are created. Whereas GitHub is a web server tasked with housing the new versions and merging them with the already stable code build.

Researched answer: With research I fail to find much else to add other than my given answer.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The two operators that will return a boolean value to my knowledge are "AND" as well as "OR".

Researched answer: After looking into it, there also seems to be an operator called "NOT" that will return a boolean value as well.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The difference between an array's index and value is as follows; 1) an index dictates the location of the value in the array starting at 0, 2) an array's value is the data actually located at a certain index.

Researched answer: From what I can tell, I offered an overall valid explanation of them. Indexing an array will return a value's location within the array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are groups of data which can hold any datatype be it numbers, strings, booleans etc. Strings are bits of text written in "" that are used to dictate a certain output. A commonality that brings them together is the ability to place a string within an array.

Researched answer: An array holds a collection of elements within it that can be a variety of values, whereas a string is a collection of characters that are treated soley as such.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming breaks down into two roles: Driver and Navigator. The driver has hands on the keyboard and is inputting information given by the navigator, whereas the navigator does the opposite, they are not to touch the keyboard and focus strictly on giving instructions and watching for errors inputted by the driver. After a certain duration passes, the roles swap to give both partners an opportunity to opporate in both roles.

Researched answer: Specifically my research points out that two (or more) developers work together on a single computer. I had not made that exact notation. Pair programming is all about communication and collaboration.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result.

2. Jest: Jest is a javascript specific testing framework which is designed to "ensure correctness of any javascript codebase."

3. Objects: An object is a standalone entity that is a collection of properties and types that make up some sort of item that is comparable to physical objects.
